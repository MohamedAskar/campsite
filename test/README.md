# Unit Tests Documentation

This document provides an overview of the focused unit test suite implemented for the Campsite application.

## Test Coverage Overview

We have implemented **8 essential unit tests** covering the most critical business logic:

### Domain Layer Tests (4 tests)

#### Entities Tests
- **`test/domain/entities/campsite_test.dart`** (2 tests)
  - Tests the critical business logic: `yearsOfHosting` computed property
  - Validates edge case for current year vs previous years

- **`test/domain/entities/campsite_filter_test.dart`** (1 test)  
  - Tests the essential filter logic: `hasActiveFilters` and `activeFilterCount`
  - Validates different filter combinations in a single comprehensive test

#### Use Cases Tests
- **`test/domain/usecases/get_campsites_test.dart`** (2 tests)
  - Tests basic use case functionality and error handling
  - Uses the shared test helper for clean, maintainable tests

### Presentation Layer Tests (3 tests)

#### Controllers Tests
- **`test/presentation/controllers/campsite_filter_controller_test.dart`** (2 tests)
  - Tests the core filtering business logic and state management
  - Covers filter updates, clearing, and the critical `applyFilters` method
  - Tests multiple filter combinations in realistic scenarios

- **`test/presentation/controllers/theme_controller_test.dart`** (1 test)
  - Tests theme toggling and direct setting functionality
  - Validates the complete theme cycle: system → light → dark → system

### Core Layer Tests (2 tests)

#### Extensions Tests
- **`test/core/extensions/strings_test.dart`** (2 tests)
  - Tests the `capitalize()` method with common cases and edge case
  - Validates error handling for empty strings

### Test Helpers

- **`test/helpers/campsite_test_helper.dart`**
  - Provides reusable test data and mock repository
  - Contains `CampsiteTestHelper` for creating consistent test entities
  - Contains `MockCampsiteRepository` for use case testing

## Testing Philosophy

This streamlined approach focuses on:

1. **Business Logic Only**: We test computed properties, filtering algorithms, and state transitions
2. **Critical Path Coverage**: Tests cover the most important user-facing functionality  
3. **Edge Cases**: Only the most likely edge cases that could cause real issues
4. **Maintainability**: Fewer tests mean easier maintenance and faster test runs

## What We DON'T Test

- Basic property getters/setters (provided by Freezed)
- Simple constructors and equality (generated code)
- Trivial functionality that's unlikely to break
- Every possible edge case combination

## Key Business Logic Covered

### 🧮 **Campsite.yearsOfHosting**
Critical business calculation for displaying hosting experience.

### 🔍 **CampsiteFilter Logic** 
Complex filter counting and active filter detection used throughout the UI.

### 🎛️ **Filter Controller**
The heart of the search functionality - validates all filter operations and the sophisticated filtering algorithm.

### 🎨 **Theme Controller**
User preference management with proper state cycling.

### 🔧 **String Utilities**
Common text processing used across the app.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all focused tests
flutter test test/domain/ test/presentation/ test/core/ test/helpers/

# Quick run - all tests complete in ~2 seconds
flutter test test/domain/ test/presentation/ test/core/
```

## Benefits of This Focused Approach

1. **Fast Feedback**: Tests run quickly, encouraging frequent execution
2. **High Signal-to-Noise**: Every test validates critical functionality
3. **Easy Maintenance**: Fewer tests mean less maintenance overhead
4. **Focused Coverage**: Tests target the code most likely to have bugs

This lean test suite provides confidence in the core business logic while avoiding over-testing of trivial functionality.
